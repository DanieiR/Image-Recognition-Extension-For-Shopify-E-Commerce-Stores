# Image-Recognition-Extension-For-Shopify-E-Commerce-Stores

To save customers from the hassle of manually searching or filtering through products on different websites, our image processing system provides customers with an easy way to filter specific items that they want to search for by just uploading an image of the item they want on their desired E-Commerce website, it also provides e-commerce websites with a new feature which is guaranteed to boost their sales.

"I have this item and want to purchase a similar one, but I don’t know its exact name and don’t want to search the entire store manually for similar ones, what do I do?" is something that we ask ourselves often in our daily life when shopping for a specific product online. We plan to solve this problem for you by offering a reliable and easy solution. With our image processing system, even if you don’t know the specific name of a product, you can simply take an image of the clothing item that you have and upload it to the website, the website will then filter it through our image processing plugin and show you an entire collection of similar items that are available on the store that you uploaded the picture to.
